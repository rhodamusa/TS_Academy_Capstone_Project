## 🔗 Live Deployment

**👉 [https://earlywarningfoodpricemonitor-group3.streamlit.app/](https://earlywarningfoodpricemonitor-group3.streamlit.app/)**

The app provides a three-month price outlook for five key commodities across Adamawa, Borno and Yobe — three conflict-affected states in Northeast Nigeria where food insecurity is most acute. No technical knowledge required.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Food price volatility in Northeast Nigeria is driven by a compounding set of structural forces: the Boko Haram insurgency, the June 2023 fuel subsidy removal, naira devaluation, seasonal harvest cycles, and climate variability. Existing price monitoring systems report prices retrospectively — after market changes have already occurred.

This project addresses that gap by building a **data-driven forecasting pipeline** that predicts monthly retail food prices **up to three months in advance**, giving policymakers, humanitarian organisations, traders and farmers the lead time needed to act before a crisis arrives.

**Three models were built, evaluated and compared:**
- SARIMA — classical seasonal time series model
- XGBoost — gradient boosting with exogenous features
- Facebook Prophet — decomposable trend-seasonality model

All models were evaluated against a naive baseline across one-month, two-month and three-month forecast horizons.

## 📦 Key Features

- **Multi-model pipeline** — SARIMA, XGBoost and Prophet trained and evaluated on identical data splits
- **Walk-forward evaluation** — all models evaluated at H1, H2 and H3 horizons (SARIMA at H1 only)
- **Structural break handling** — binary `subsidy_removed` regressor explicitly marks the June 2023 fuel subsidy removal in all models
- **Tiered evaluation** — Tier 1 (Adamawa, Borno, Yobe) with fixed date splits; Tier 2 (10 states) with proportional splits
- **Credibility filter** — combinations above 35% MAPE labelled directional-only rather than production-ready
- **Live deployment** — Streamlit app with Model Comparison and Forecast Explorer pages
